# Molecular Simulation & Scientific Computing

This project involves molecular simulation and scientific computing using Python. It includes numerical models for chemical structure analysis, molecular simulation, and data processing pipelines for 3D crystal structures.

## Features
- Developed numerical computing models for chemical structure analysis and molecular simulation.
- Optimized scientific algorithms for cheminformatics applications.
- Integrated machine learning with molecular structure prediction.
- Implemented data processing pipelines for analyzing 3D crystal structures.

## Requirements
To run the simulations, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Usage
Run the Python script to perform molecular simulations:
```bash
python molecular_simulation.py
```

## Visualization
The simulation initializes a molecular system, computes total energy using the Lennard-Jones potential, and visualizes the initial molecular configuration in 3D space.
